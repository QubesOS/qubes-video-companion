Qubes Video Companion is a tool for securely streaming webcams and sharing
screens across virtual machines.

It accomplishes this by creating a uni-directional flow of raw video that is
passed from one virtual machine to another through file descriptors thereby
allowing both machines to be completely air-gapped with no networking stacks
exposed. This design makes the side of the video sending virtual machine 100%
immune to attack and only leaves a very small attack surface on the side of
the video receiving virtual machine.

The project emphasizes correctness and security all thae while also sporting
superb performance by maintaining a small footprint of the available
computational resources and low latency even at Full HD and greater
resolutions at 30 or more frames per second.

This package contains the video-sending portion of Qubes Video Companion.
